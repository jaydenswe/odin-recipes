  <li>4 skinless <strong>chicken breasts</strong></li>
  <li><strong>vegetable oil</strong>, for greasing</li>
  <li>handful <strong>fresh coriander</strong>, to garnish</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Place all the marinade ingredients in a food processor – or use a hand blender – and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a bowl.</li>

  <li>Preheat the grill to high. Brush a baking tray with vegetable oil.
  </li>
  <li>Carefully thread each chicken strip onto a skewer, lining up the skewers on the baking tray.
